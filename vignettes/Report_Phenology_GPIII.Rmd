Search for all products in MODISTools and get the right one

```{r}
# load the library
library("MODISTools")

# list all available products
# (only showing first part of the table for brevity)
MODISTools::mt_products() |> 
  head()

View(mt_products())
```

Select from the chosen products the right bands, which are Greenup.Num_Modes_01 and Maturity.Num_Modes_01.

# list bands for the MOD11A2
# product (a land surface temperature product)
MODISTools::mt_bands("MCD12Q2") |> 
  head()

View(mt_bands("MCD12Q2"))

```


```{r}
# load libraries
library(MODISTools)

# download and save phenology data
phenology <- MODISTools::mt_subset(
  product = "MCD12Q2",
  lat = 43.5,
  lon = 74.5,
  band = "Greenup.Num_Modes_01",
  start = "2001-01-01",
  end = "2009-12-31",
